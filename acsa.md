**Understand the difference between a Region, an Availability Zone (AZ) and an Edge Location**

- A **Region** is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more Availability Zones (AZ's).

- An **Availability Zone** is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

- **Edge Locations** are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN). *PS: There are many more edge locations than regions*

**Identity Access Management 101 - Exam Tips** [[FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/iam/faqs/)]

- Identity Access Management consists of the following:

	- Users

	- Groups

	- Roles

	- Policies

- **IAM is universal.** It does not apply to regions at this time.

- The **"root account"** is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.

- New users have **NO permissions** when first created.

- New Users are assigned **Access Key ID** & **Secret Access Keys** when first created.

- **These are not the same as password**. You cannot use the Access Key ID & Secret Access via to login into the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line, however.

- You only get to view the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key once. If you lose them, you have to **regenerate** them. So, save them in a secure location.

- Always setup **Multifactor Authentication** on your root account.

- You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.

**S3 (Simple Storage Service) 101 - Exam Tips** [[FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/faqs/)]

- Remember that S3 is **Object-based**: i.e. allows you to upload files.

- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.

- There is unlimited storage.

- Files are stored in Buckets (ItÂ´s basically a folder in the cloud).

- **S3 is a universal namespace**. That is, names must be unique globally.

- URL Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

- **Not suitable to install an operating system on**.

- Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code.

- By default, all newly created buckets are **PRIVATE**. You can setup access control to your buckets using:

	- Bucket Policies

	- Access Control Lists

- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account.

- You can turn on **MFA Delete**.

- **The Key Fundamentals of S3 Are:**

  - Key (This is simply the name of the object).

  - Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes).

  - Version ID (Important for versioning).

  - Metadata (Data about data you are storing).

  - Subresources:

    - Access Control Lists

    - Torrent

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.

- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate).

- **1. S3 Standard**: 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

- **2. S3 - IA** _(Infrequently Accessed)_: For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.

- **3. S3 One Zone - IA**: For where you want a lower-cost option for Infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.

- **4. S3 - Intelligent Tiering**: Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

- **S3 Glacier**: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. Retrieval time configurable from minutes to hours.

- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

	- Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)

- Client Side Encryption	 

#

**S3 Versioning - Exam Tips**

- Store all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object).

- Great backup tool.

- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.

- Integrates with Lifecycles rules.

- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.

#

**S3 Lifecycle Management, S3 IA and Glacier - Exam Tips**

- Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers.

- Can be used in conjunction with versioning.

- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.

#

**Cross Region Replication - Exam Tips**

- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.

- Regions must be unique.

- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.

- All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.

- Delete markers are not replicated.

- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.

- Understand what Cross Replication is at a high level.

**CloudFront - Exam Tips**

- **Edge Location** - This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ.

- **Origin** - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be either an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or Route 53.

- **Distribution** - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.

- **Web Distribution** - Typically used for Websites.

- **RTMP** - Used for Media Streaming.

- Edge Locations are not just READ only - you can write to them too. (ie put an object on to them.)

- Objects are cached for the life of the **TTL (Time To Live)**.

- You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged.

- CloudFront is a global service.

- You can invalidate cached objects, but, you will be charged.

**Storage Gateway - Exam Tips**

- **File Gateway**

	- File Gateway - For flat files, stored directly on S3.

- **Volume Gateway**

	- **Stored Volumes** - Entire Dataset is store on site and is asynchronously backed to S3.

	- **Cached Volumes** - Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site.

## Chapter 4: EC2 <img src="images/ec2.png" width="30px">

**EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) 101 - Exam Tips** [[FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ec2/faqs/)]

- **EC2 Pricing Policies:**

  - **1. On Demand**: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

  - **2. Reserved**: Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance.

  - **3. Spot**: Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.

  - **4. Dedicated Hosts**: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licences.

  If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

- **EC2 Family Instance Types - Mnemonic**

  - **F** - For FPGA

  - **I** - For IOPS

  - **G** - Graphics

  - **H** - High Disk Throughput

  - **T** - Cheap general purpose (think T2 Micro)

  - **D** - For Density

  - **R** - For RAM

  - **M** - Main choice for general purpose apps

  - **C** - For Compute

  - **P** - Graphics (think Pics)

  - **X** - Extreme Memory

  - **Z** - Extreme Memory AND CPU

  - **A** - Arm-based workloads

  - **U** - Bare Metal

**EC2 Labs - Exam and Use Tips**

- **How to login (SSH) in the EC2 instance?**

  - Create a new key in the moment of instance creation, or use an existing key

  - Get the instance's public IP address

  - Execute the command: `$ ssh ec2-user@<public-IP-address> -i <keyname>.pem`

- Termination Protection is **turned off** by default, you must turn it on.

- On an EBS-Backed instance, the **default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted** when the instance is terminated.

- EBS **Root** Volumes of your DEFAULT AMIÂ´s cannot be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker, etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMIÂ´s (lab to follow) in the AWS console or using the API.

- Additional volumes can be encrypted.

#

**Security Groups Lab - Exam Tips**

- All Inbound traffic is blocked by default.

- All Outbound traffic is allowed.

- Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.

- You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.

- You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances.

- Security Groups are **STATEFUL**.

- If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.

- You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists.

- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

**EBS (Elastic Block Storage) 101**

<p align="center"><img src="images/aws-ebs-types.png" width="500px"></p>

#

**Volumes & Snapshots - Exam Tips**

- Volumes exist on EBS. Think of EBS as a virtual hard disk.

- Snapshots exist on S3. Think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk.

- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes.

- Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.

- If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create.

- To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

- However you can take a snap while the instance is running.

- You can create AMIÂ´s _(Amazon Machine Images)_ from both Volumes and Snapshots.

- You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type.

- Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.

- To move an EC2 volume from one AZ to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new AZ.

- To move an EC2 volume from one region to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to the other. Then use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region.

#

**AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store) - Exam Tips**

- Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage.

- Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. if the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.

- EBS Backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.

- You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.

- By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

#

**Encrypted Root Device Volumes & Snapshots - Exam Tips**

- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.

- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.

- You can share snapshots, but only if they are **unencrypted**.

- These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.

- You can now encrypt root device volumes upon creation of the EC2 instance.

- _You need to know how to:_

  - Create a Snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.

  - Create a copy of the Snapshot and select the encrypt option.

  - Create an AMI from the encrypted Snapshot.

  - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.
