- **Merging two dicts in Python 3.5+ with a single expression**

  ```
    # How to merge two dictionaries
    # in Python 3.5+

    >>> x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    >>> y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

    >>> z = {**x, **y}

    >>> z
    {'c': 4, 'a': 1, 'b': 3}

    # In Python 2.x you could
    # use this:
    >>> z = dict(x, **y)
    >>> z
    {'a': 1, 'c': 4, 'b': 3}

    # In these examples, Python merges dictionary keys
    # in the order listed in the expression, overwriting
    # duplicates from left to right.
