- A **Region** is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more Availability Zones (AZ's).

- An **Availability Zone** is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

- The **"root account"** is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.

- New users have **NO permissions** when first created.

- New Users are assigned **Access Key ID** & **Secret Access Keys** when first created.

- **These are not the same as password**. You cannot use tha Access Key ID & Secret Access via to login into the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line, however.

- Always setup **Multifactor Authentication** on your root account.

- You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
