## Introduction

**What is DevOps?**

- Defining DevOps

  - DevOps = **Dev** (Development) + **Ops** (Operations)

  - Different people define DevOps in a variety of ways

  - _"DevOps is a software engineering Culture and Practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops)..."_

  - _DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives."_ (Wikipedia, 2018)

  - DevOps is first a **Culture** of colaboration between developers and operations people

  - This culture has given rise to a set of **Practices**

  - DevOps is a grassroots movement, by practitioners, for practitioners

**DevOps Is NOT...**

- DevOps is NOT tools, but **Tools** are essential to success in DevOps

- DevOps is NOT a standard

- DevOps is NOT a product

- DevOps is not a job title

**Agile Software Development**

- DevOps grew out of Agile software development movement

- Agile seeks to develop software in small, frequent cycles in order to deliver functionality to customers quickly and quickly respond to changing business goals

- DevOps and Agile often go hand-in-hand

## DevOps Culture

**The Goals of DevOps**

- DevOps Culture

  - DevOps Culture is about **collaboration** between Dev and Ops.

  - Under the traditional separation between Dev and Ops, Dev and Ops have **different** and **opposing** goals.

  - With DevOps, Dev and Ops work together and share the same goals.

- With DevOps:

  - Dev and Ops are playing on the same team

  - Dev and Ops share the same goals

  - The goals include things like:

    - Fast time-to-market (TTM)

    - Few production failures

    - Immediate recovery from failures

- DevOps is about Dev and Ops work together.

- In a DevOps culture, devs care about stability as well as speed, and ops care about speed as well as stability.

- The traditional roles of developers and operational engineers can even become blurred under DevOps.

- Instead of "throwing code over the wall", dev and ops work together to create and use tools and processes that support both speed and stability.

- DevOps recognizes that dev and ops are more powerfull when they are together.
