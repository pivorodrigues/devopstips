### Who are CREs (Customer Reliability Engineering)? How can they help you be more reliable?

**CRE's Three Reliability Principles**

- **1.** Reliability is the most important feature

- **2.** Users, not monitoring, decide reliability

- **3.** Well-engineered...

  - _software_ = 99.9%

  - _operations_ = 99.99%

  - _business_ = 99.999%

**Reliability in the cloud**

- 28-day error budget **99.9%** = 40 min

- 28-day error budget **99.99%** = 4 min

### Why are SLOs important for your organization?

**How SLOs help you balance operational and project work**

***Question:*** _What is the right level of reliability for the system you support?_
