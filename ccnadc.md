## Network fundamental principles

- Network: Bidirectional communication (the interconnected devices must be able to send and receive data)

- Hierarchy: (3 layers classic model)
  - Core (Fast forward) `Routers`
  - Distribution (Filters, VLans, Services and QOS) `Switches`
  - Access (Provides port density and performance) `Switches`
