## 1. About NGINX

- **Basic HTML Virtual Host**

```
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;
        index index.html;

        location / {
            default_type "text/html";
            try_files $uri.html $uri /index.html;
        }

        # Adds Video Streaming
        location /video/ {
            mp4;
        }
    }
}
```

- **NGINX vs Apache**

  - **Apache:** By default, Apache is configured in what's called prefork mode, meaning that had spawned a set number of processors, each of which can serve a single request at a time regardless of whether that request is for a PHP script or an image.

  - **NGINX:** NGINX deals with the requests asynchronously, meaning that a single NGINX process can serve multiple requests concurrently, with that number basically just depending on the system resources available to the NGINX process.

      NGINX, unlike Apache, can't embed server side programming languages into its own processes, meaning that all requests for Dynamic Content has to be dealt with by a completely separate process like PHP-FPM *(FastCGI Process Manager)* and then reverse proxy back to the client via NGINX.

  - **Apache:** Apache accepts a preconfigured number of requests, rejecting the rest.

  - **NGINX:** NGINX will serve static resources without the need to involve any server side languages. NGINX also can handle concurrent requests and potentially receive thousands of requests in a single processing thread, and respond to them as fast as it can without turning down any of those requests. These features make NGINX provides **faster static resources** and **higher concurrency** than Apache.
