### Amazon S3

**Amazon S3 Bucket Properties**

  - **Versioning -** Versioning enables you to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. By default, versioning is disabled for a new bucket.

  - **Server access logging –** Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to your bucket. By default, Amazon S3 does not collect server access logs.

  - **Static website hosting –** You can host a static website on Amazon S3. To enable static website hosting, choose **Static website hosting** and then specify the settings you want to use.

  - **Object-level logging –** Object-level logging records object-level API activity by using CloudTrail data events.

  - **Tags –** With AWS cost allocation, you can use bucket tags to annotate billing for your use of a bucket. A tag is a key-value pair that represents a label that you assign to a bucket. To add tags, choose Tags, and then choose **Add tag**.

  - **Transfer acceleration –** Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket.

  - **Events –** You can enable certain Amazon S3 bucket events to send a notification message to a destination whenever the events occur. To enable events, choose **Events** and then specify the settings you want to use.

  - **Requester Pays** – You can enable Requester Pays so that the requester (instead of the bucket owner) pays for requests and data transfers.
