### Numbers and Operations

- Number types: int and float

  - We can use the function **type()** to discover what type of number we are using.

    _Example:_

    ```
      a = 5
      type(a)
    ```

  - We can convert types of numbers.

    _Example:_

    ```
      a = 5
      float(a)

      a = 5.5
      int(a)
    ```
